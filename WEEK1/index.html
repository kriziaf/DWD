						<h2>Establish a Visual Hierarchy</h2>
						<p>Traditional publishing formats like newspapers and magazines offer good examples of how to apply a visual hierarchy to fonts. They combine fonts in way that visually separates different textual elements like headlines, sub-headlines, body copy, and captions. Qualities such as size, boldness (also known as weight), and spacing (including leading, the space between lines, and kerning, the space between letters) all contribute to how the eye should navigate the page and what text should attract attention first.</p>
					</div>

					<div id="copyXheight" class="hideCopy">
						<h2>Steer Clear of Conflict</h2>
						<p>When combining fonts, you do want contrast, but you don’t want conflict. Just because fonts are different doesn’t mean they will automatically work well together. Generally speaking, typefaces that share a couple qualities — maybe they have similar proportions, or the lowercase letters have the same height (known as x-height) are more likely to look harmonious together, even if the overall appearance differs.</p>
					</div>

					<div id="copyFamily" class="hideCopy">
						<h2>Use Fonts from the Same Family</h2>
						<p>Using typefaces from the same family is always a safe bet; after all, they were created to work together. Look for families that come with a range of options (different weights, styles, cases) to ensure that you have enough variation for your purposes.</p> <br>
						<p>When pairing fonts that come from the same family, you have to plan carefully to create contrast, varying things like font size, weight (such as light, regular, and bold), and case (upper, lower, small caps).</p>
					</div>

					<div id="copyContrast" class="hideCopy">
						<h2>Avoid Pairing Fonts that are Too Similar</h2>
						<p>Choosing fonts that are too similar (i.e., don’t have enough contrast) becomes problematic. You’ll have trouble establishing a hierarchy, because the fonts aren’t visually distinguishable from each other. And any differences that are discernible may look more like a mistake than a purposeful choice.</p> <br>
						<!-- <p>But fonts don’t have to be exactly alike to be incompatible. Typefaces that are somewhat different but have comparable weights, proportions, and/or letter shapes may be similar enough to make your design look confusing and indistinct, especially when used at the same size — like the pair above, despite the fact that one has serifs and the other doesn’t. Here’s an easy way to test whether two or more fonts might be too similar: Place them side by side on your screen, then sit back a little and squint. If the fonts look basically the same, then that’s a good indication that your design could benefit from turning up the contrast between your type choices.</p> -->
